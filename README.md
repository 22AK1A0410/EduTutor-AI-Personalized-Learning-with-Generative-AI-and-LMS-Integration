**🎯Project Overview**

EduTutor_AI is an innovative project that leverages the power of IBM Watsonx AI's Granite-13B Instruct-v2 model to provide personalized learning experiences.By generating human-like responses to user prompts, this project aims to enhance education through adaptive and intelligent tutoring tailored to individual needs.

**Features**

1. Personalized Learning Paths

2. Generative AI-Powered Content Creation

3. LMS Integration

4. AI Tutoring and Chat Support

5. Real-Time Analytics & Dashboards

**🛠️Tools & Technologies**

IBM Cloud Pak for Data: Infrastructure for managing and deploying AI models. IBM Watsonx.ai: Platform for building and scaling AI solutions. IBM Granite-13B Instruct-v2 Model: Advanced generative AI model for creating human-like responses. Python: Core programming language for development. Jupyter Notebook / IBM Watson Studio: Environment for model development and experimentation. FeaturesGenerates personalized educational content based on user prompts.Utilizes state-of-the-art generative AI for natural and engaging responses.Scalable and deployable on IBM Cloud for real-world applications.

**Advantages**:

Adaptive learning: The AI can continuously assess student performance and adapt its instruction to help students overcome challenges and reinforce concepts.

Interactive Learning: EduTutor AI can create interactive learning experiences that engage students and make learning more enjoyable.

**Disadvantages**:

Dependence on Data Quality

Biased Data: If the data used to train EduTutor AI is biased, the AI may perpetuate these biases, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
